# You can use the parser library to parse arguments (and use groups to classify arguments for different frameworks).
# The parser should include 4 types of arguments:
# 1: For the workload tracer itself
# 2~4: For PyTorch, DeepSpeed, and Megatron-LM (at this stage, focus on completing PyTorch arguments based on the examples in /test).
